                    This design system project is an effort to capture the essence of a
                    software's user experience & eliminating the noise from the music.

                    Ezence is intended to be a minimalistic, straightforward and no-frills
                    design system, that has quick but meaningful user interactions for both
                    the web and mobile platforms. Currently, Ezence is at a nascent design/development stage and is forecasted
                    to be production ready by <code>v1.0.0</code>. So, everything is meant to
                    change here, rampantly.
